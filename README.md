# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
## is an expansion on the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.  Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

>  As we got the inspiration from the big bang theory, it will be themed appropriately.

## The rules are the following:

###### - Scissors cuts Paper
###### - Paper covers Rock
###### - Rock crushes Lizard
###### - Lizard poisons Spock
###### - Spock smashes Scissors
###### - Scissors decapitates Lizard
###### - Lizard eats Paper
###### - Paper disproves Spock
###### - Spock vaporizes Rock
###### - (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
